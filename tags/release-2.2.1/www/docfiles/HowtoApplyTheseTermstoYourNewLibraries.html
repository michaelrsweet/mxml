<H2><A NAME="6_1">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</A></H2>
<P>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
 the ordinary General Public License).</P>
<P>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It
 is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
 effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
 at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is
 found.</P>
<PRE>
<VAR>one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.</VAR>
Copyright (C) <VAR>year</VAR>  <VAR>name of author</VAR>

</PRE>
<P>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
 mail.</P>
<P>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
 your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,
 if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</P>
